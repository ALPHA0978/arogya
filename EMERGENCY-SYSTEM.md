# Emergency Smartwatch IoT Integration - Arogya Health System

## 🚨 **IoT EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The Arogya Emergency Smartwatch is an IoT (Internet of Things) device that continuously streams vital signs data to the Arogya Health Platform. When the smartwatch detects emergencies (falls, shocks, cardiac events), it triggers the AI emergency response system within the Arogya software, which then handles all emergency protocols.

**System Architecture**:
```
Smartwatch (IoT Device) → Real-time Data Stream → Arogya Platform → AI Analysis → Emergency Response
```

- **Cardiac Events**: Heart rate irregularities + blood pressure spikes
- **Collapse Detection**: GPS altitude change + accelerometer impact
- **Medical Emergencies**: Combined sensor data indicating distress

#### **Arogya Platform Emergency Response**
When IoT data indicates emergency:
1. **AI Analysis**: Arogya software processes sensor data
2. **Emergency Classification**: Determines emergency type and severity
3. **Automatic Response**: Platform triggers emergency protocols
4. **Hospital Integration**: Arogya system contacts nearest hospital
5. **Family Alerts**: Platform sends notifications to emergency contacts
6. **Voice Assistant**: Arogya AI provides real-time guidance through watch
